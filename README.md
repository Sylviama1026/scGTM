# scGTM: Single-cell generalized trend model

**scGTM** is the abbreviation for *Single-cell Gene Expression Generalized Trend Model*. This is a R package for modeling the statistical relationship between pseudotime and gene expression data. The paper is available at [bioRXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.25.470059v1).

It is intended for bioinformatic scientists, applied statisticians, and students who prefer using Metaheuristic algorithms in solving their own bioinformatic optimization problems. scGKM is able to provide various marginal gene distributions with interpretable regression functions.
